\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
I identify myself as a physicist, in a social science department, working mostly on software development.
Because of my interdisciplinary research background,
I have experience in processing, analyzing and visualizing a variety of data in natural science and social science.
The typical data pipeline in my current institute involves queries from a Microsoft SQL Server,
which teaches me solid knowledge in SQL.

Over the last two and a half years,
I have been working on a Kotlin project for my PhD -
an agent-based simulation framework and a turn-based strategy game in 4D, relativistic spacetime,
such that people can utilize it to study interstellar societies.
The game has a http-based server-client architecture for multiplayer and a functioning GUI,
and the computation and communication are parallelized by coroutine.
The software follows good software development practice, e.g., having unit testing and logging.
I am quite proud of being able to create such a cool software from scratch,
and I have presented the project in many different conferences including KotlinConf.
Since Kotlin is closely related to Java,
I have the confident to be a competent Java developer as well.

Besides academic work, I am an enthusiastic open source contributor. 
Whenever I come across a bug in an open source software,
I always try to fix it and contribute back a pull request if possible.
It is fun to learn about new projects and pick up new programming languages.

\lettersection{Why Adyen?}
As someone from academia,
I am always curious about how it is like to work on real-world application
on a global scale.
Adyen, being a top player in the payment industry,
provides such an opportunity.
Being in the Netherlands for a while,
I really appreciate Dutch's inclusiveness and directness,
which are also the core values of Adyen.
The competitiveness and the vision of Adyen make it an attractive workplace.

In conclusion, my technical capabilities and data-oriented research experiences
fit well for this position.
Thank you for your consideration, I am looking forward to hearing back from your team.
