\begin{cvletter}

I am writing to express my strong interest in the "Digital Scholarship Manager" position at Hong Kong Baptist University. This opportunity excites me because it aligns perfectly with my background and my desire to contribute to the advancement of research services in Hong Kong.

At the Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS) at Leiden University, I have gained extensive experience in science studies research. CWTS is renowned for revolutionizing university research services, and through my association with the center, I have been deeply involved in bibliometric analysis, research evaluation policies, funding management, and open science initiatives. Recently, I have been working with the open research information group to transition our data services to utilize open databases such as OpenAlex. I believe this experience will be particularly beneficial to the Hong Kong Baptist University Library, both in embracing open science practices and achieving cost savings.

I have developed software for both scientific and social sciences applications, including statistical analysis, textual data processing, network analysis, and simulation. My technical skills extend beyond academic software; for example, I have developed a game for PC and Android devices. Recently, I created a library to integrate local large language models, vision language models, and retrieval-augmented generation into a game engine. To promote my projects, I have produced tutorials, documentation, and demos, and actively participated in community discussions and conferences. Notably, my large language model library has become a popular tool in the community. My blend of technical expertise and communication skills would be a valuable addition to the Digital Initiatives and Research Cluster team.

My interdisciplinary academic background in physics, mathematics, social science, and software development has given me a broad understanding of the needs of academic staff across diverse disciplines. I have successfully organized conferences, events, and workshops involving administrative and library staff at Leiden University, showcasing my ability to collaborate effectively with various stakeholders. Additionally, my fluency in Cantonese, English, and Putonghua enables me to work seamlessly with local, mainland Chinese, and international colleagues.

Thank you for considering my application. I am currently in Hong Kong to complete my thesis and would welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further.
