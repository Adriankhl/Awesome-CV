\begin{cvletter}

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the "Software Engineer" position at Hong Kong University. As a social scientist and software developer, I am deeply passionate about creating software solutions that cater to the needs of the Social Sciences and Humanities. As I am finishing my Ph.D., I am excited about the prospect of leveraging my skills to contribute to the Arts Technology Lab and make a meaningful impact in this field.

My academic journey has been a unique blend of physics, astrophysics, and computational social science, providing me with a diverse and robust skill set that aligns well with the role. I have a proven track record in multiple technical domains, including proficiency in C, Python, SQL, Linux systems, and simulations. One of my flagship projects is a sophisticated agent-based simulation framework and a game written Kotlin. The framework, designed with a strong foundation in physics, includes proper design patterns, extensive unit/integration tests, and comprehensive documentation. This project showcases my ability to independently translate complex academic ideas into well-designed software products.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am an active contributor to open-source projects. I regularly contribute bug fixes and introduce new features to various software that I use on a daily basis. These experiences have sharpened my skills in learning, debugging, and collaborating with unfamiliar technologies and codebases, demonstrating my readiness to tackle new challenges head-on.

While my educational background may not be in computer science, I have consistently demonstrated my ability to self-study and acquire necessary computer science knowledge whenever required. For instance, during the development of my simulation framework, I studied algorithm optimization and coroutines to enhance its performance. I am confident in my aptitude to quickly grasp and apply any new knowledge that is relevant to the work at the Arts Technology Lab.

Throughout my academic journey, I have excelled in diverse, cross-cultural collaborations, honing my teamwork and communication skills. I have taken the initiative to organize technical workshops for non-technical people and actively participate in events promoting open science. These experiences have equipped me with the ability to thrive in collaborative environments and contribute effectively to cross-functional teams.

Thank you for considering my application. I am eager for the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further in an interview and explore how my skills and passion align with the exciting work at Hong Kong University. I am confident that my unique blend of academic expertise and software development skills would make me a valuable addition to the Arts Technology Lab.
