\begin{cvletter}

I am writing to express my strong interest in the "Senior Educational Technology Officer" position at Lingnan University. This opportunity excites me because it aligns perfectly with my background and my passion for advancing educational technology in Hong Kong.

My academic journey has uniquely blended physics, computational social science, and software engineering, providing me with a diverse and robust skill set. I have conducted data analysis and developed software for both the sciences and social sciences. Notably, I created an educational game that effectively illustrates complex physics concepts, demonstrating my capability to support educational technology initiatives at Lingnan University.

Recently, my interests have expanded to large language model inference. I developed a large language model library in C++ for the Godot game engine and created tutorials and demos to illustrate its usage. The library’s easy accessibility and detailed documentation have made it a popular tool within the community.

My interdisciplinary academic background has given me a broad understanding of the needs of academic staff across diverse disciplines. At Leiden University, I successfully organized conferences, events, and workshops involving administrative and library staff. Additionally, I actively support my software on GitHub and Discord, showcasing my ability to collaborate effectively with various stakeholders. My fluency in Cantonese, English, and Putonghua further enables me to work seamlessly with local, mainland Chinese, and international colleagues.

Thank you for considering my application. I am currently in Hong Kong to complete my thesis and would welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further.
