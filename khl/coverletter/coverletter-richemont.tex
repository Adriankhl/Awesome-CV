\begin{cvletter}

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the "Senior Analyst / Assistant Manager, Workforce Analysis, Cost Planning \& Controlling - Cartier" position at Richemont.


As a dedicated researcher and accomplished software developer with a strong foundation in data-oriented challenges, I am eager to leverage my skills and expertise in a practical business setting through this role.

My journey began in the realm of physics, where I embarked on rigorous data analytical research involving complex astronomical data. This experience has honed my proficiency in C, Python, Linux systems, supercomputing, and simulations. Building upon this foundation, my PhD research led me to the exciting field of computational social science. Notably, I conducted projects analyzing gender biases in academic funding application systems, solidifying my expertise in Python, pandas, SQL, and databases.

To continuously broaden my skill set, I dedicated substantial effort to crafting a sophisticated simulation framework and developing a game using Kotlin, a language closely related to Java. These undertakings underscore my adaptability to diverse object-oriented languages and frameworks, a trait I believe is crucial in effectively addressing evolving data challenges.

In parallel with my academic pursuits, I have actively contributed to open-source projects. This evolution from a scientific programmer to a versatile software engineer highlights my commitment to excellence in software development and my ability to embrace new challenges.

Throughout my academic journey, I collaborated with individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds, cultivating strong teamwork and communication skills. This experience has equipped me to thrive in collaborative environments and to effectively contribute to cross-functional teams.

I am excited about the prospect of bringing my data analytical and software engineering skills to the role of data engineer at Sun Hung Kai Properties. The opportunity to contribute to your team's innovative projects and make a meaningful impact aligns perfectly with my aspirations. I am eagerly anticipating the chance to discuss how my background and expertise align with your company's vision and needs.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss my qualifications in an interview.
