\begin{cvletter}

I am thrilled to apply for the "Junior Software Scientist" position at the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), as it perfectly aligns with my background in science and extensive experience in software development. I am excited about the prospect of leveraging my skills to contribute to cutting-edge scientific software projects.

My journey began in physics, where I honed proficiency in technical areas, including C, Python, Linux systems, supercomputing, and simulations. These skills have well-prepared me for the role of a software scientist, enabling me to tackle complex technical challenges with confidence. Building on this foundation, my PhD research took a unique trajectory, blending my expertise in quantitative social sciences. Despite facing setbacks caused by engineering mistakes at an external institute, I pivoted to software development to rescue my PhD. I directed my efforts towards creating a sophisticated simulation framework and a game using Kotlin, tailored to study interstellar societies while considering relativistic physics. The framework boasts proper design patterns, unit/integration testing, and thorough documentation, showcasing my competence as a developer.

Beyond academics, I have actively contributed to open-source projects, offering features, bug fixes, and documentation improvements. To further complement my knowledge in computer science, I have been self-learning design patterns, algorithms, data structures, and operating systems. My commitment to open-source projects and continuous learning reflects my dedication to becoming a well-rounded software engineer.

Through my doctoral studies, I collaborated with individuals from diverse backgrounds, often in remote settings due to the pandemic. This experience refined my collaborative skills, enabling me to work effectively within multidisciplinary teams across geographical boundaries.

I have been eagerly seeking a role where I can collaborate with experts across domains on scientific software projects, making STFC a natural fit for my aspirations. I am excited about the possibility of contributing to STFC's projects. Thank you for considering my application.
