\begin{cvletter}

I am writing to express my strong interest in the ``Mathematics Teacher'' position at Maryknoll Fathers' School. With a deep passion for education and a solid academic background, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your school's mission.

I hold a master's degree and a bachelor's degree from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, majoring in physics and minoring in mathematics. Driven by my passion to apply scientific knowledge to make a positive impact on society, I decided to pursue a doctoral degree in quantitative social sciences at Leiden University in the Netherlands, where I am currently in the final stage of completion. During my doctoral studies, I developed a keen interest in education and even created an educational game to illustrate complex physics concepts, which further motivated me to return to Hong Kong and engage in secondary school teaching.

While I have not yet taught full-time in a secondary school, I have gained valuable teaching experience through various positions during my academic and youth service career. These opportunities have allowed me to work with individuals from diverse backgrounds, honing my ability to adapt my teaching methods and cater to the unique needs of students. Notably, my voluntary work with the Boy's Brigade has required me to establish strong relationships with secondary school students and provide them with academic guidance. I am confident that my experience and adaptability will enable me to create a positive and inclusive learning environment for students at your school.

As a quantitative social scientist, I have had plenty of exposure to real-world applications of mathematics and physics. While the specialized knowledge acquired through academic research may differ significantly from the content of secondary school textbooks, the curiosity, critical thinking skills, and data analysis abilities cultivated in research are invaluable assets. I am eager to guide students in developing these skills and instilling in them a lifelong passion for learning. Additionally, my participation in the International Physics Olympiad, where I proudly earned a silver medal, and my subsequent role as a mentor for the Hong Kong team have provided me with a unique perspective on mathematics and physics education. I am confident that I can provide additional mathematics, physics, and STEAM training, further enriching the educational experience of students.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review. Currently, I am in Hong Kong to complete my thesis. I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further.
