\begin{cvletter}

I am writing to express my strong interest in the ``Physics Teacher'' position at Ying Wa Girls' School. As a researcher with a deep passion for education and being a Christian myself, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your school's mission.

I hold a master's degree and a bachelor's degree from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, majoring in physics and minoring in mathematics. Driven by my passion to apply scientific knowledge to make a positive impact on society, I decided to pursue a doctoral degree in Social Sciences at Leiden University in the Netherlands, where I am currently in the final stage of completion. During my doctoral studies, I developed a keen interest in education and even created an educational game to illustrate complex physics concepts, which further motivated me to return to Hong Kong and engage in secondary school teaching.

Throughout my academic and youth service career, I have held various teaching positions, gaining extensive experience instructing individuals from diverse backgrounds. While I have not yet taught full-time in a secondary school,  I possess the adaptability to tailor my teaching methods to suit the needs of different students. Notably, my voluntary work with the Boy's Brigade has required me to establish strong relationships with secondary school students from different backgrounds and provide them with academic guidance. I firmly believe that my skills and experience will enable me to meet the needs of students at your school.

Although the specialized knowledge acquired through academic research may differ significantly from the content of secondary school textbooks, the curiosity, problem-solving skills, and data collection abilities cultivated in research are invaluable lifelong assets. Therefore, I am eager to guide students in developing these skills through my teaching. Moreover, I had the honor of representing Hong Kong in the 2012 International Physics Olympiad, where I proudly earned a silver medal. Additionally, I served as a mentor for the Hong Kong team in 2016. Combining these experiences with my research background, I am confident in my ability to provide additional mathematics, physics, and STEAM training to students.

As a committed Christian actively involved in local and international church communities, I understand the importance of integrating faith into all aspects of our lives. I am committed to creating an environment where students can grow academically, morally, and spiritually.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review. Currently, I am in Hong Kong to complete my thesis. I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further.
